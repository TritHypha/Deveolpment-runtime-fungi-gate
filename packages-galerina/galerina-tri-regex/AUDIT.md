# TriRegex v0.1.1 — build audit

Audit updated 2026-07-28. Scope: supply chain, fail-closed
surfaces, bound enforcement, test evidence, declared gaps.

## Supply chain
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** devDependencies only: `typescript`, `@types/node`.
- No network, filesystem, process, or environment access anywhere in `src/`
  (pure computation; the only `node:` imports are in tests).
- No `Date.now` / `Math.random` / locale-dependent calls — fully deterministic;
  identical inputs give identical verdicts, spans, and step counts.

## Fail-closed surfaces (verified by tests)
- `compile()` **never throws on pattern content** — every refusal is a value
  `{ok:false, verdict:-1, code, reason}` (`test/refusals.test.mjs`, incl. a
  hostile-pattern corpus).
- Refusal completeness: backreferences, lookaround, named groups, `\b/\B`,
  unknown alpha escapes, malformed syntax, and **all budget bounds**
  (pattern length, repetition cap, expanded-instruction cap) each have a
  named test. Unknown constructs are refused, never guessed at.
- Streaming `end()` collapses INDETERMINATE to `-1` (K3 collapse-at-boundary,
  `test/streaming.test.mjs`).
- Runtime budget overrides are validated as finite safe integers. `NaN`,
  infinity, fractions and invalid negative values cannot bypass a limit.
- Lazy, possessive and stacked quantifier spellings are refused. They were
  previously reinterpreted as nested repetition (`a+?` could match empty).
- The terminal MATCH instruction now counts toward `maxInstructions`.

## Bound enforcement (the ReDoS claim, evidenced)
- The certificate (`instructions`, `restingStates`, `perCharWorkBound`,
  `boundaryWorkBound`, `maxRangeComparisons`) is
  produced **before** any input runs; the engine counts its own work in the
  same unit and the suite asserts
  `steps ≤ chars × perCharWorkBound + boundaryWorkBound` on classic killer
  patterns over adversarial input (`tests/redos.test.mjs`). The bound now
  includes active-slot tests, range comparisons, bitset unions, start
  propagation and stream-boundary scans.
- EOL resolution and fresh end matches are precomputed, rather than performing
  uncounted epsilon walks during `end()`.
- Quantifier expansion is budget-checked **during** emission — an over-budget
  pattern aborts as a veto mid-compile; it cannot escape into a big automaton.

## Correctness evidence
- 34/34 tests green: semantics (literals/alt/classes/anchors/quantifiers/
  epsilon-loop termination/astral Unicode/escapes), leftmost-longest spans,
  chunk-split invariance at **every** split point per case, mid-stream verdict
  transitions, anchored mid-stream impossibility, eol-until-boundary, uniform
  mode equivalence, version-drift (VERSION === package.json).
- A deterministic generated corpus compares the supported language-membership
  intersection against native Unicode `RegExp`; span policy is deliberately not
  compared because TriRegex is leftmost-longest.
- Stream lifecycle tests establish idempotent `end()` and refusal of
  `feed()` after the boundary.
- `test()` is literally `stream(feed all) + end()` — whole-vs-chunked
  equivalence holds **by construction**, not by luck.

## Declared gaps (v0.1 — honest, not hidden)
- No capture groups; span is the first leftmost-longest match only.
- No certified `findAll`; this blocks direct use as Myco's regex backend.
- `\b/\B` refused (v0.2 candidate: needs one code point of lookbehind state —
  compatible with the no-rewind design).
- ASCII shorthand classes; no case-insensitive mode; no multiline `^$` mode.
- `uniformScan` is early-exit-off only; a dense constant-shape scan (true
  data-oblivious stepping) is design-stage v0.2. No constant-time claim is
  made for JS.
- One engine path (sparse bitset). Performance is untuned and **no performance
  numbers are claimed** (house rule: measured on a named machine or not at all).
- `memoryBoundBytes` is a portable accounting estimate, not a JavaScript heap
  ceiling; runtime object overhead is engine-specific.
- Publication is BLOCKED until `LICENSE` contains the full Apache-2.0 text.

## Galerina vendor state

This is Galerina's own vendored package copy. It was refreshed on 2026-07-28
from the standalone TriRegex 0.1.1 working tree based on commit
`e9fbb8e75281a5a9c6270348e976bc1ffee5630b`, then re-tested here. The upstream
0.1.1 changes were not committed at the time of the sync, so this package
records a **working-tree snapshot**, not a falsely claimed pinned commit.
Implementation fixes still belong upstream and must be re-vendored.

TLL use remains PROPOSED. The numeric pattern result is not TLL `Verdict3`;
matching neither sanitises data nor grants authority.
