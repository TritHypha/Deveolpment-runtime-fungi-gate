// cli-check-scope.test.mjs — `galerina check` must never report a pass over
// zero files (GD-026).
//
// THE DEFECT, measured before the fix. `ignore` patterns from
// galerina.check.json are applied AFTER file discovery. A pattern broad enough
// to cover every discovered file left the filtered list empty, so the per-file
// loop never ran, the error counter stayed at 0, and the run fell through to
// `PASS: Check passed` with exit 0 — a green byte-identical to a real one,
// produced by checking nothing. A file that exits 1 uncovered exited 0 once an
// `ignore` pattern covered it.
//
// WHY A CONTROL PAIR. Asserting only that the suppressed case refuses would not
// show WHY it refuses — a broken fixture would produce the same exit code. Each
// case below runs the SAME valid source twice, changing ONLY the config, so the
// verdict flipping from pass to refusal can be caused by nothing else.
