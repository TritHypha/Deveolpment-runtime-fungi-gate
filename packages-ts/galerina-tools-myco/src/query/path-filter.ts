// path-filter.ts — restrict a search to part of the indexed tree (`--in`).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: without it, scoping a search meant pointing myco at a subtree
// as its ROOT, which builds a SECOND index there (`<subtree>/.myco`). So "search
// only the compiler's src" cost a whole extra index, and the two indexes then
// drifted independently. Field report 2026-07-25: a session wanted "does this
// token appear anywhere under packages-ts/**/src" and had no way to ask.
//
// WHY IT IS DANGEROUS, AND WHAT THAT FORCES: a path filter is a COVERAGE CAP the
// user asked for. myco's whole contract (DESIGN §8/§10) is that a cap which hides
// what it dropped turns "no matches" into a lie — the same rule that makes the
// over-size skip and the word-boundary exclusion report themselves. A filter is
// worse than those two, because a typo'd glob (`--in src/` on a tree that stores
// `source/`) excludes EVERYTHING and returns a clean, confident zero that is
// indistinguishable from a genuine absence. So this module reports:
//   - how many candidates the filter removed  (`excluded`)
//   - whether it matched NOTHING in the index (`matchedNothing`) — the typo case
// and the caller is expected to surface both. Nothing here silently narrows.
//
// GLOB SEMANTICS — deliberately NOT the same as the ignore-file compiler in
// walk.ts, and the divergence is the point:
//   - walk.ts globs are ANCHORED whole-path/basename tests for ignore rules, and
//     support `*`/`?` only. Extending that compiler would change ignore semantics
//     for every rule in every .gitignore in the tree — a much larger blast radius
//     than this feature earns.
//   - here a metacharacter-free pattern is a SEGMENT-AWARE PREFIX, because that is
//     what a person means by `--in packages-ts`: everything underneath it.
//     Prefix matching on raw strings would also match `packages-ts-enterprise`,
//     which is a different project — so the boundary is the `/`, not the character.
// Supported: `*` (within one segment) · `**` (across segments) · `?` (one non-slash).
// Paths tested are POSIX and root-relative — the form walk.ts stores (walk.ts:27).
